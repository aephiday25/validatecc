# validatecc : Credit Card Number Validator

Currently only support for 16 digits credit card number and for bank in Indonesia.

## Background  

When I was working in a telemarketing insurance company as a data analyst, I found some problems. One of it was "How to know the credit card number that will be used as payment channel is valid or not in a short time?". Because if the telemarketing officer hanging up the phone after closing and then check the validation of credit card number it will take more cost and time, and even the customer can cancel the insurance policy.

So I decided to create a fast enough way to solve this problem. Once, I use Microsoft Excel as user interface and use it formula. 

Now I use shiny to create a more pleasing user interface.
